# Algorithm(COMP9007)

## Designing an algorithm
Three steps:
1. Describe your algorithm:  
- Always describe your approach in plain English 
- Optionally, add pseudocode or figures

2. Argue correctness
- Should be a general argument/proof
- You canâ€™t show correctness by showing that your approach returns the correct solution on a specific example

3. Analyze the running time
